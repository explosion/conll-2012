# CoNLL 2012 Data

This is a slightly cleaned up version of the official CoNLL 2012 data designed
to simplify setting up the training data. 

Note this data contains only skeleton files, and must be combined with a copy
of OntoNotes to produce the real training data.

The original data is available [at this link](https://conll.cemantix.org/2012/data.html).
